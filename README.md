## 🔎 Purpose

This repository introduces the **SG Global Civilizational Resilience OS**, an AI-powered architecture designed for **disaster prevention, long-term ecological balance, cybersecurity stability, economic foresight, and human safety protection**—powered by **TRINITY AI** and **EAGLE EYE global monitoring systems**.

❗ **No military weaponization.**  
🛡 **Only for humanitarian, environmental, economic, and civil defense.**

## 🧪 Quick Example

```python
from src.simulators.civilizational_resilience_simulator import CivilizationalResilienceSimulator

sim = CivilizationalResilienceSimulator(TRINITY_AI, EAGLE_EYE)
result = sim.analyze_civilizational_risk({"domain": "healthcare_system"})
print(result)
