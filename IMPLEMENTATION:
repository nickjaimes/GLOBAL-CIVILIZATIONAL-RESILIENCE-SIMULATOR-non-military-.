1️⃣ Convert your Multi-Domain Threat Matrix into a GLOBAL CIVILIZATIONAL RESILIENCE SIMULATOR (non-military).

🔹 Reframe from warfare model → systems resilience model
🔹 Detect & predict crisis patterns across cyber, climate, finance, infrastructure, health, social stability
🔹 Output recovery strategies & TRINITY adaptive learning outcomes

2️⃣ Establish the SG ETHICAL AI GUARDIAN LICENSE (Covenant Clause).

🔹 Explicitly restrict SG technology from use as a weapon
🔹 Allow humanitarian, protective, stability, disaster-prevention and peacekeeping use
🔹 Define “AI Covenant Protocol” as system kernel rule

SG Global Civilizational Resilience Simulator
-------------------------------------------------------
Transforms multi-domain threat analysis into predictive,
non-military crisis modelling for humanitarian purposes.

Powered by:
- TRINITY AI (Adaptive Optimization & Healing)
- EAGLE EYE (Wide-spectrum Data Fusion)
Constraints:
- Only permissible for civilian defense, disaster prevention,
  critical infrastructure protection, and humanitarian readiness.
